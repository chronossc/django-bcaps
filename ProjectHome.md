This project use data from awesome Browser Capabilities Project (http://browsers.garykeith.com/, by Gary Keith) to fill a model in Django and provide a middleware that add browser info to request.browser.

The project for now is a alpha, need a lot of improvements to be usable in every request, but is a nice start.

**Any** help are very much welcome :), check issues!
